# About

Hi, I am Blake! I thoroughly enjoy the outdoors and am engaged by various topics in mechanics, mathematics, and robotics. I am currently seeking opportunities in both research engineering and robotics engineering positions in Pittsburgh, PA. Feel free to take a look at <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io" target="_blank">my website</a> for more information. 

If you are a potential employer in search of a way to assess my coding skillset, consider visiting <a href="https://github.com/blakerbuchanan/algosdatastructs.git" target="_blank">Algorithm and Data Structure Implementations (Python)</a> for my Python implementations of various computer science basics. Note that this repository undergoes continuous modifications, but will always contain working examples for the content available.

Additionally, you may be interested in my skillset in the area of nonlinear control. A few working tutorials can be found at <a href="https://blakerbuchanan.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">Nonlinear Control Tutorials in Julia</a>, the code for which is available at <a href="https://github.com/blakerbuchanan/controlsProblems.git" target="_blank">think repository</a>
