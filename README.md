# About

Hi, I am Blake! I currently reside at <a href="https://www.neyarobotics.com/">Neya Systems</a> as a Senior Robotics Engineer. Prior to Neya, I spent some time at <a href="https://www.sarcos.com/">Sarcos Robotics</a> and RE2 Robotics as an Autonomy and Motion Planning Engineer, solving impactful problems in robotics spanning a variety of applications, such as <a href="https://www.sarcos.com/robotics-applications-and-use-cases/solar/?utm_term=&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=**Elevated+-+Sarcos+-+DSA&utm_source=adwords&hsa_cam=18291646526&hsa_src=g&hsa_mt=&hsa_ver=3&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_tgt=dsa-19959388920&hsa_acc=2971379278&hsa_grp=141075101517&hsa_kw=&hsa_ad=620765362461">robotic solar field construction</a>, among others. I also thoroughly enjoy the outdoors and am engaged by various topics in mechanics, mathematics, and robotics.
